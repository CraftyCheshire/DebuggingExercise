# Objective
- Use Google Developer Tools to capture secret messages from a deployed website. This exercise is designed to help you understand and utilize breakpoints in JavaScript debugging.

# Instructions

- Navigate to the "Sources" tab in the Developer Tools.
- Find the script.js file in the file explorer within the "Sources" tab.
- Set breakpoints at the lines where fetchSecretMessage function calls are made.
- Interact with the website as needed to trigger the JavaScript code execution.
- When each breakpoint is hit, capture the secret message displayed on the page.
- There are 10 secret messages corresponding to tasks 1-10.

# Assignment Submission
